# Final-Year-Project

This repository contains Machine Learning Project which was undertaken for Final Year of Engineering (UG). <br>

-> Project title: Rice Plant Yield Prediction and Disease Prediction using Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks. <br>

-> Project objectives: <br>
(1) Predict the yield of the plant by collecting suitable dataset of the rice plant and understand the effect of the weather on the crop yield.<br>
(2) Predict if the rice plant is going to be healthy or suffering from any disease (BrownSpot) <br>

-> Algorithms used: <br>
(1) Multiple Linear Regression. <br>
(2) Convolutional Neural Networks. <br>

-> The Machine Learning Models are locally deployed using Flask. <br>

-> Libraries used for Regression Model: <br>
(1) Pandas <br>
(2) Numpy <br>
(3) Scipy <br>
(4) Scikit-Learn <br>
(5) Matplotlib <br>
(6) Seaborn <br>
(7) Flask <br>
(8) Pickle <br>

-> Libraries used for Convolutional Neural Networks: <br>
(1) Numpy <br>
(2) Keras <br>

(5) Matplotlib <br>
(6) Flask <br>

-> Tools used for Web Interface: <br>
(1) HTML <br>
(2) CSS <br>
(3) Javascript <br>

-> The datasets of the project are available on the Kaggle Website.
